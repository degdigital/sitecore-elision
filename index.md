Sitecore Elision is a free, open-source development accelerator for the Sitecore Experience platform.

## What problem does it solve?
This framework solves many problems that we have faced as Sitecore engineers and website developers. Here are the big ones:

* Faster time to delivery, since many common tasks and settings are already prepared
* More configuration, less code, since the rules engine has been extended and enhanced
* Modular site design, through the use of Elision themes.
* Clear patterns for development based on an already robust library of components
* Promotes testable code organization and sustainable use of unit tests and dependency inversion

## How do I get started using it?
We're working on an example website that can be examined and easily emulated to fully understand how simple it is to build a site with Elision, but until that's ready, check out the [online guide]({{ "/guide/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

## MVC
This framework and library fully embraces MVC as the technology of choice for website development. In order to keep the code base simpler, reduce the testing and regression burden, and clarify the purpose of many code files and classes, WebForms is not supported.

## Sitecore 8
Elision is intended for use on Sitecore 8 and newer. All of the targeted Sitecore versions can be found on the [downloads page]({{ "/downloads/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
